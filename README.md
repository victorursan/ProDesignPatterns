In this folder I'll be going step by step from the Chapter 3 forwards with the patterns and projects from the book Pro Design Patterns in Swift by Adam Freeman.

1. Creating an Unstructured iOS App Project
-------------------------------------------
In this part, I with the help of the book, will create a basci iOS App Project with no specific pattern or structure

2. The Object Template Pattern
------------------------------
In this part, I'll divide everything, conforming the pattern, into classes/ structures
